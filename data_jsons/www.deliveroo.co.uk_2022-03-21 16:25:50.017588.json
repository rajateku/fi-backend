[{"content": "I have been a deliveroo plus customer until recently as I decided to cancel my membership. I was quite annoyed to find out that in some cases, deliveroo is charging a higher price on the dishes on top of the restaurant prices. This is despite being a plus member and paying an admin fee on every order. The actual straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me was a large order I made through them. I placed a large order for a group of friends for a special Friday occasion. It was placed well with plenty of time ahead of expected delivery. The order showed as processed, then out for delivery then as the driver was literally one minute away I got a notification saying the order was cancelled. The customer support told me they cancelled that large order because one side dish was not available.This is super problematic on many counts. - the fact that they cancel a large order just because a side dish is not available . They could have refunded the side dish and send the ones that are available - the fact that they can cancel an order made 1hour in advance literally last minute- the fact that the status update on the app is so unreliable. How can it show the order complete and almost arrived but cancelled when driver was 1 minute awayThis has ruined my Friday and I don\u2019t forgive them. Only thing they offered was a ridiculous \u00a35 credit which I refusedStay away from this overpriced joke that is deliveroo", "created_at": "2022-03-21T14:37:49.000Z", "rating": "Rated 1 out of 5 stars", "title": "Overpriced and poor customer service\u2026"}, {"content": "Only the 2nd time of using deliveroo and probably never again!
