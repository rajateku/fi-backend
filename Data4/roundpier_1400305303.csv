False,4,yurgre1908,This is a great platform for HS. It appears to have the largest database of extracurricular activities as well as many student organizations. The quality of content is very good and people are very helpful. Also some good insights on colleges etc. The app itself isn‚Äôt perfect and can be improved.,2019-12-28 22:10:08,Good app but needs improvement,"{'id': 13650705, 'body': 'Thanks for your review!

False,5,Bethie üíó,"I‚Äôve had the app for a little over a month now, and I can truly say it is nothing like any of the other educational apps of its kind. Unlike other apps, this platform focuses specifically on junior high and high school students instead of mostly college students. I‚Äôve met some really successful students and organization founders that are willing to share their stories and experiences with other students on the platform.

The amount of opportunities, student groups, and articles is amazing. I‚Äôve already started my own student group, and I‚Äôm planning on starting more in the fall for some of my school‚Äôs clubs! Especially when some students aren‚Äôt able to go to school physically right now, RoundPier‚Äôs school clubs and student groups are the best way to stay connected.

RoundPier is definitely my favorite high school app. I will be recommending it to my high school counselor soon!! üòÅ",2020-07-29 12:14:54,Unique High School Platform,
False,3,s.elei,"The idea of the app itself is amazing. I feel like with progress and development, this app could skyrocket. Schools and educational institutions can take advantage of this app to better their students. Who knows? Maybe students will begin to genuinely achieve more awards and such.

Here‚Äôs the thing though. There are many errors that present themselves throughout the app. City names aren‚Äôt capitalized, words are misspelled, and the overall formatting of the app (in my opinion) is more complicated than it needs to be. If it were to work more like a social media app, perhaps it‚Äôd look more aesthetic. That‚Äôs simply my opinion, though. Changing the formatting to fit a social media aesthetic could cross a dangerous border; however, transforming into a simplistic style would appear more pleasing. (Again, my sole opinion.)

If the developers are reading this, please take note that professionalism is key for RoundPier‚Äôs success. I‚Äôd love to present the idea of implementing this app for my school, but it simply isn‚Äôt reliable. No one would trust a scholarly app that contains more than a handful of spelling errors. Formatting? That‚Äôs different and relies on personal opinions. Spelling errors? That‚Äôs a major red flag for any education-based app.

I‚Äôd love to see where this app heads. What I‚Äôve mentioned up above is my personal opinion, but I hope the developers of RoundPier take it all into consideration.",2019-05-09 02:20:04,Needs Some Improvement,"{'id': 8689911, 'body': 'Hi there!

False,5,Lidbliss üòä,"My favorite part of RoundPier is the students who use it. I became part of a philosophy podcast, started a club, and joined a few organizations through RoundPier and the fellow high schoolers I've worked with are just amazing. They are intelligent, chill, funny, and hardworking.

There are always new opportunities posted by student organizations to be a leader or member. Because many of those types of posts looked for marketing directors, I realized my interest in marketing. I finally figured out what I wanted to do in college (before that I was lamenting in my ""I have no idea what the heck I'm going to do"" state).

The app itself needs some work. One strange thing that often happened to me is I'd be DMing Person A, but in the same feed for Person A the newest message from Person B would pop up. 

That isn't a big deal because I see RoundPier's main purpose as the initial connection to a potential team member or friend. After connecting on RP, we'd use Slack, WhatsApp, etc as our main communication method.

I'd recommend RoundPier especially if you're an organization or someone:
- looking for team members/directors
- seeking volunteer hours
- wanting to start a club/org",2021-01-23 17:26:35,Met some wonderful people,
False,3,Andgiet,"As the title states, the app is great for posting and browsing through the RoundPier platform, but the delays of going from one page to another is very annoying. The message feature doesn‚Äôt even work and parental confirmation is a drag that has JavaScript technicalities. The web version is 1000x better than the app, and should be rated as 5 stars, as long as the listed bugs are fixed.",2021-06-20 00:36:15,"Good App, but lacks technical structure and needs a major bug rework",

False,2,tayloriskatniss,"The app seems okay so far, however it is new and there are already a few problems!

When you first fill out the required information, one of the boxes says ""Location intiotution"" when it should say ""Location institution"".

If you submit the required fields without filling each in, a message pops up saying ""please fill all fealds"". It should read ""please fill all fields"".

When choosing a location, the search results never load. This may be a problem on my end, but will not load. Also, if you click out of this box, the information you entered switches to another box for some reason!

I cannot get past the first page because it will not allow me to enter the information. As soon as it works I am looking forwards to trying the app!",2018-07-15 23:32:23,"Seems okay, needs a bit of tweaks!",

False,1,anon.teen,"I downloaded this app after being extremely dissatisfied with the web version, having been told that the app was better. It‚Äôs not. Whoever designed this should put some serious work into it.

These are my main issues:
1. I keep trying to turn off the notifications on the app settings- there‚Äôs too many and the vast majority of them are not things I want to see at all. I don‚Äôt want to be notified every time someone comments on a post I commented on. I don‚Äôt want to be notified when someone updates their profile. But no matter what I do in the settings, I can‚Äôt change this. 
2. The connection feature is absolute trash. I keep getting connected with people I NEVER APPROVED. It‚Äôs getting annoying having to disconnect from so many people. 
3. Their ‚Äústudent coalition‚Äù for student organizations is useless. Supposedly they help people recruit better- I‚Äôve seen none of that. Supposedly colleges will recognize this- have seen no proof of this, and I highly doubt colleges are going to recognize something that‚Äôs just started and is still very small- especially since their design is terrible. It just seems like a way for Roundpier to get more people on their site since they ask that organization members join roundpier.
4. The groups are so badly designed. There‚Äôs no way to sort the messages so things get lost very easily. Some of the times the file upload button doesn‚Äôt work. Organizations also can‚Äôt post directly on the different groups. 
5. The search feature really doesn‚Äôt work that well. Half the times I search for something and can‚Äôt find it, but then a few days later will see it on some group or something.

In essence, this app is straight up garbage. They market themselves as a LinkedIn for high schoolers but can‚Äôt even get networking features right. Not to mention, this app has barely given me any new recruits for my organization despite having supposedly so many students. And forget about trying to find internships on this site- just use linkedIn to find professors. As for summer programs, just use the actual programs‚Äô websites. They‚Äôre all so much better designed.",2020-06-17 15:01:56,Quite a few issues,"{'id': 16055083, 'body': ""Thanks for your review.
