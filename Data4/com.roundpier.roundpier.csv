Maye because it’s on the mobile app and most of the people use the desktop version, so I would recommend adding this feature to the website. 2) The Ambassador Logo: The Ambassador Logo which was promised in the RoundPier Ambassadors Program came very late, so I would recommend doing it a little quickly if possible :). Also, I can’t see it on my profile, but can see it in the comments when I post something on the mobile apps. Lastly, this feature is not visible on the website too. 3) ECs, Job Experience, Volunteering Hours: I don’t know if it’s only me or everyone, but I can’t add any of my ECs, Volunteering Hours, etc. On the website, so please fix it. This is possible through the app, but even that has limitations. If the address of the organization is too large (as shown by Google Maps), the ‘+’ button with the cyan backdrop almost goes out of my mobile device’s screen, due to which I can’t add it. So, please fix this issue too. 4) Tutor: I haven’t used this feature but I think this is a great tool, and I think it should be ported to the website too, since most of the people use the website, I think that’s gonna help people a lot. 5) App Interface: The app interface is good, but I think you should try to change the colors of the app, ad dull grey does not seem to appeal the visual demand of the viewer (again a personal experience :) ) Overall, it is a very great app (●'◡'●)",5,3,1.49,2021-06-19 09:36:05,,

Also this app becomes extremely boring after a while. It's basically a bunch of student Nonprofits trying to sell themselves.
