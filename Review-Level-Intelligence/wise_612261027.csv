False,5,Dr. Alec Harvey,2019-04-26 13:00:39,"I did quite a bit of research into money transfer apps and platforms and TransferWise seemed to meet all my needs. I opened a Borderless account and have now used it to make several transactions—moving funds between various onshore accounts and converting between currencies.  Unless I’m missing something, the platform, the process and the app all work flawlessly.

With just a few clicks my money is moved into my Borderless account in one country, converted from one currency to another, and moved into an external account in a different country.  The fees are low and I get the forex spot rate not some 5 or 6 pt spread between buying and selling that pays criminally high broker fees; I’ve saved literally hundreds of USD on one transaction alone.

With some platforms you pay more to get an easy process; with others the cost is low but you have to jump through a lot of hoops. TransferWise is that rare situation where the process is easy AND the cost structure is low. I love it, easiest 5-stars I’ve given in a long while.",Exceptionally effective way to manage funds internationally,
False,4,Lanni88,2019-10-15 11:08:11,"I’ve availed TransferWise service for several years now and had great results. Although recently I had an unusually untimely transfer (4 days). In addition I was a bit confused by the overly long estimated time conveyed by TransferWise on a subsequent transfer (6 days) but after submitting the transfer and to my surprise I received the funds in less than two hours, which is about the speed in which I normally receive the funds. I want to clarify my previously poor feedback toward TransferWise. The service I have received is for the most part Great! My only complaint is the recent estimate for the completed transfer. I understand your companies position that it would be better to over estimate the transfer timeframe and deliver the funds earlier than proposed, and I’m trying to wrap my head around that logic because that works great for most people I’m sure. But... in my situation an estimate of 6 days for a Debit/ACH transfer leaves me wanting to initiate my transfer 5 days early, but If the transfer completes in only a few hours it then creates another issue with my billing cycle at my bank and fees. Overall I rate your service as highly recommended. I will just have to cross my fingers and hope the funds arrive as they have in the past. 
Thank you,

False,1,Badbluesman,2021-01-16 19:05:29,"I spent hours over the weekend trying to add a new recipient. However the app would never accept the person’s street address. After trying 8 or 9 versions of the address, I finally closed the app and reopened and started all over (a very time consuming process). I finally was about to set up my new recipient. The next roadblock came when I tried to send money to that recipient. I already had a bank account linked to another recipient, but apparently you have to set up your own bank all over again with each new recipient. I did this. The transfer appeared to be underway, but was flagged. An email said that it “needed attention.” When I tried to go to that transfer, I got stuck in an endless merry-go-round in which it would say you must go to TransferWise online to solve the problem. When I did, it just sent me back where I started. After repeating this 5 or 6 times, I tried closing the app and reopening it to no avail: the merry-go-round continued. And of course THERE IS NO PHONE SUPPORT ON WEEKENDS, so you are completely out of luck. I still don’t know the status of my last attempted transfer. I don’t even know if the money was debited from my account or not! In the future I will be taking my money transfer business elsewhere. I would NOT recommend TransferWise to anyone.

False,4,Tomaszy,2019-01-18 07:58:28,"I have very few complaints with TransferWise and this app. It generally works as advertised and I have used it for a number of months now with few problems. One glitch is TransferWise’s interface with banks (U.S., at least), which sometimes does not recognize your account has been verified and asks to reverify it by confirming a couple of micro-deposits - a process which can take several days. However, if you cancel the transfer which prompted the request to reverify, then try it again, this has always resulted in a successful transfer on the second attempt for me. Both the app and desktop version of TransferWise also have trouble sometimes dealing with verification questions used by many banks. One additional feature which would be useful for the app (essential, in my opinion, for a 5-star rating) is the ability to download a pdf receipt for a transfer, showing all relevant account information and date/time of the transfer events, as you can from the desktop web site. Despite the above issues, I’m satisfied with my experience and TransferWise is an excellent alternative to international bank wires, especially for smaller amounts.","App works well, needs a couple features",

The “mandatory form” required to sign yearly and to every new recipient is from a 3rd party “Exchange4Free,” which takes forever to actually email the form and this results in complications with the transfer, which of late, has resulted in having to cancel transfers. I don’t think these “Wise” and “Exchange4Free” are in proper communication, which makes me think that wise (to maintain its credibility) has no idea how long the forms really take to reach recipients. When contacting wise, their customer service has always been awfully bad- no real interest in assisting clients and no real help whatsoever, leaving you with no option but to cancel transactions. I really enjoyed using this app in the past and hope that major improvements are made as I am very tempted to find a different company for my international transfers.

False,5,GT-Marenti,2021-03-26 13:24:11,"I’ll speak solely with what I have used Wise for.
In my case, I found this app looking for an efficient method to transfer money between my USD and EUR accounts. 
I live in Spain, but I used to live in the US. I constantly need to transfer USD to EUR for my everyday expenditures here in Spain, but I also need to transfer EUR to USD because of stuff that I still pay with my US credit cards.
Wise has been my solution for that. And how magnificent has it been.

The interface is great and easy to understand. The pairing with my Bank Accounts was fast and easy. It remembers the previous transactions that I’ve made in case I want to repeat the same amounts, I can do it with just 2 taps. And it ALWAYS gives me the best rates. I often check the current official price of USD to EUR (or viceversa), and Wise’s exchange rate is always extremely close to it. Which is great. It means you save more money.

I’ve also had to contact Customer Support once in the 6 months I’ve used Wise, and my experience was great. I really have no complaints in regards to the customer service experience. I called with a problem, and they gave me a solution on the spot in just 15 minutes. Good stuff!

I’m very much looking forward to recommend and keep using Wise for currency exchange between my accounts in the foreseeable future!
