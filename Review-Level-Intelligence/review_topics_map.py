review = "Iâ€™ve used this app for quite sometime but for some reason, they started recently to provide poor service, rates are not good, if you lock a rate and the rate became not in their favor, they try anyway to escape and cancel it, no real resolution for issues, money take long time to arrive, it was about to cost me a fortune by losing big sum due to mistake from one of the customer service, so I decided to look for another service provider."
